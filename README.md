# Box How-To

## I. Setting Up Box

### a) Creating a Box Account

To create a Box account, open the project invitation email and click **Accept Invite**.

On the signup page, fill in your name and a password, then click **Continue**.

![*You can use the same password you use when logging into your email, if it helps you remember*](https://draftin.com:443/images/25305?token=t1mypp88McrisO80RSF4W-sAo9vpfiIZ015UogaeKXxK52QRt9HB9J5uWBAMpDsZ00Xm-cJ5nnyRa3oYGlgmyT8)

You should see a darkened welcome page. Click the arrow (**›**) to skip the welcome screens and view your Box account.

Finally, you will see a list of ARTGrant folders. Click **Accept** next to each folder to access their contents.

### b) Uploading Existing Files

In order for others to view and access your files, you'll need to first upload them to Box.

To upload your files, open the folder in Box where you want to save them and click **Upload** > **Upload Files**.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25258?token=XqeVx-4oONEy7ZklsaxvOGRTuiDjXPa2UB4K3HyE9rcNniCif1fyC-UJqU7T2gxoGap4basR-lamC8T_x5Sgi4Y)

Select the file(s) you want to upload and click **Open** to upload them to Box.

### c) Installing Box Edit

Once you've uploaded some files to Box, it's time to install **Box Edit**.

Box Edit lets you edit files in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and have the changes you make saved to Box automatically, instead of having to upload each new version manually.

To install Box Edit, pick any file in Box (e.g. a Word document), open the context menu, and click **Edit**.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25270?token=9K71yX59IgJ_Z2S7RGjG4TeKiDBTaeJfojwOYubqP4kfRKKqRQC66h80RhjESPx_LLEPjkytz96T8ijfvNy3LNk)

At this point, Box will ask to install **Box Edit**.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25271?token=g6HAQQ1CMFR-0o3_EsRwsMLtH54Ek58gXlLk4TSX_i2haTX9CaGU7ZEEgQWbAbUFHb8ru8worIqB7sHvYM0HD98)

Click **Download**, then click **Run** on the installer to install Box Edit.

![*Follow the installer's directions...*](https://draftin.com:443/images/25273?token=jDpieFOOFxOMwX4BiWC4SES-pC-M7fP67wDtH73w7qGdwxeVKJjpytoQqnWKleqbBiqewZRolFMebYdSaJOII5Y)

Finally, when Box asks, close your browser.

Now when you click **Edit** on a file in Box, it will open in its associated program.

![*Edit files you've uploaded in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint*](https://draftin.com:443/images/25264?token=C5azwRHDTUQt3To_e1H0NDUXj4dzTdb-F1rwJz0HrqFSvMxJAHNWGVA02P2a3iBXgkY1p_IW5tdgVGQSVOHwN_U)

As you edit and save in Word, your changes will be saved to Box automatically.

## II. Working with Files

To make sharing information easy in this project, everyone can view everyone else's files in Box.

To avoid inadvertently overwriting someone else's work and help others avoid overwriting your work, there are ways to limit access.

### a) Accessing Folders

Certain folders can only be modified by certain people. There's no need to be cautious when viewing these files and folders, however. Even if you forget and try to edit, add, or delete a file or folder, you won't be able to.

To check whether you can edit or view files, find your name in the **Collaborators** list. Your role will be listed underneath your name.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25367?token=SYK-ztjC-NdXIX4AGxvye_3uEETDGHOTfdchqs97J_rGnMdsxEeEGq9bdWzNBXjUbMWLAw5l9nHVp4oz2K25JIc) 

- An **Editor** can freely edit, add, and delete files
- A **Viewer** can preview any file in Box and download a copy, but any changes you make to the copy will ***not*** be saved to Box

![*To see a preview of any file in Box, click on its name. Use the context menu to download a copy to your computer*](https://draftin.com:443/images/25202?token=3_cU86CtxUBC1UPr-1porTaDmqeM_fZSy6e_2CnqWTUcIwhqhXxRXegYb1xYBtW4auYXV9PypgKwXEAhDkAB0No)

### b) Locking/Unlocking Files

When you're working on something in Box, it's a good idea to lock the file.

To lock a file, choose **Lock File** from the menu.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25215?token=8K0e0MfETzs2QtESd38TIU-CKWr5ifhlBoagjPaWWQo1UjK0AVfa1mIq44emSnBTZMD8YA7DObsfSRsXgqQtAjY)

Locking files helps others avoid inadvertently editing files that you're currently working on and vice versa.

![*When you lock a file, you may also opt to prevent others from downloading the file and set an expiration time, if you think you’ll forget to unlock the file*](https://draftin.com:443/images/25369?token=oqon3EVURPRB_muTXS4VGIObIPoqphHN4foN_1jyD6XRgC4D5CA8EQonHRM71UlxZGoZcWG2CzKu_KJ6gyyvjEc) 

When you're finished working on the file, choose **Unlock File** from the context menu.

![*When you unlock a file, others will be able to edit it again*](https://draftin.com:443/images/25218?token=Np_faLFdJuRX0GmUy0yzlqtq2BOITDiNJ1X3S-mNhKcwD0v2Q36pXcKBw4kx6OhheD98mepGqyfQuetYJsfdW2E)

Note: while locking a file will warn others to not edit it, they can still unlock and edit them. If you want to unlock a file, it's good practice to confirm with whomever locked the file first that they have finished working on it.

### c) Recovering Previous Versions

If you or someone else edits a file and you need to review or restore a version of the file, you can recover previous versions in Box.

Click the version number (below the file's name) to see all previous versions.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25214?token=WEkIo5bAQKM1j02BJUZL2hUaP9iXGvGj2fMVhaLpMdNHI00PUM1E9RKpuD5jQKPeexV5AeXdJa35dTbl4rrS648)

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25368?token=JlUPO8t2PZe-_OwJPQsfNlE567fQcURCv1f8sevY8B3Isi92arOiFStyK7XCeVU7bbGsWLD92j0lrNyA4qkLaEU) 

From the **Version History**, you can download previous versions of a file or revert to a previous version by clicking **Make current**.

## III. Grab Bag

### a) Sorting Files by Name

By default Box sorts files by date updated, with recent files at the top.

If you prefer sorting files by name, you can do so in Box by selecting **Name** from the view menu.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25347?token=Af9vsE6dnIfgq24I0T2J9um5upW_zy50wxdKR3Zkr6FfarjN4ZFM0emiUB1Bc3rUMmPwFRyl3giTjGSDOtK149Y)

### b) Restoring Deleted Files

When you delete files in Box, they go into your Trash folder.

You can open your Trash folder by clicking on your name in the top-right corner.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25348?token=9-zTr6OH_axtP_M7N8vPhlq1cAPQiZ2xaQj0OwJ2x5ZW49DNcAzzLfaRmwOUyEMTybTamOUFtp1e1pTn-bqtKCU)

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25349?token=2-Dfg8zUgX4QveLm_xcMQTLzZd6Yssw8mPRlX1zdWveLoDhK_q6mrFYhw2w8WbeOOC9Ng89YkFy-wjwz-osYmgc)

Deleted files are stored for 30 days. To recover a file, choose **Restore** from the context menu.

![](https://draftin.com:443/images/25350?token=xD1R0YmoNs3O8cq0KtrkCUcVFClvLgDm7qyamNJTCFr0w45pJmCDJvQ7u3rcD7Zpj9ENzSaaQqrKU7hL8Dg6umo)

If someone else deletes your file, it will be stored in their Trash folder for 30 days.

Deleting a file in your Trash folder will delete it *permanently*. Since Box has plenty of storage, there is no need to empty your Trash.

### c) Do ***Not*** Install Box Sync

When you log into Box, you may occasionally see promotions pushing you to install Box Sync. Please ignore these promotions. Box Sync is not supported for this project. Thank you!
